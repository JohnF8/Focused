# Focused

**Productivity and growth focused on chasing after a weekly focus**

Everyone desires to improve their skills and life, right? Our app helps keep people focused by enabling them to add and remind them of their weekly focus. The goal of a focus is prioritize what's important, so that the most important thing will be accomplished during the week. A students focus could be to do well on a computer science test or get more sleep(these seem to contradict). 

[This service is also avaiilable on the web](http://54.70.51.182:1000/). It access the same database, so your weekly focus will sync across devices![The front end code for this service can be found here](https://github.com/varughese/focusapp-frontend) and the [back end code here](https://github.com/varughese/focusapp-backend)


### Here's a quick tour of the app
This is the home screen, when you open the app. The current focus is loaded from the server onto this page

This is the add screen. You are prompted to enter a focus title, an overview of the focus, why you want to focus on this goal, and how you will do so. We believe this is the most effective way in reminding a person of the priorities in their life.
